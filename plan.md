# Jenkins workflow

## Options
1. Pre-pull request: When a committer pushes to `their` branch, it gets built, and 
   they get feedback on if it breaks the build.

-  Developer submits pull request to upstream, this gets merged into `develop`,
   & tested. If tests pass, then the branch is merged into `master`.


### Next steps
Deploy latest master
